# NumberGuesser
#### This is a simple C# application that invites the user to play a guessing game.

The number to guess is randomly generated by the program.

The user will enter a value between 1 and 10.

The program verifies that the value entered is of type int.

The game continues until the user guesses the correct value.

When the game ends, the program asks the user if they want to play again.
